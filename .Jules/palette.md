## 2025-05-14 - Character Counters & Text Scaling
**Learning:** Enforcing `maxLength` at the HTML level provides immediate "fail-fast" feedback. Using `aria-live="polite"` on character counters ensures screen reader users are aware of limits without being interrupted. Standardizing micro-text to `text-xs` (12px) instead of `text-[10px]` significantly improves legibility for users with visual impairments.
**Action:** Always combine `maxLength` with a visible counter in data-heavy forms. Position counters at the bottom-right of field containers to complement advisory messages at the bottom-left.

## 2025-05-15 - Interactive Diagnostics & Keyboard Focus
**Learning:** Mapping diagnostic reports (like validation errors or decoded field lists) directly to their corresponding form inputs via "jump-to-field" links significantly reduces cognitive load and manual searching. When making non-native elements (e.g., `li`, `tr`) interactive, providing explicit `focus-visible` ring styles is mandatory to maintain parity with native button accessibility.
**Action:** Use `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}` on diagnostic items, and ensure they have visible focus indicators to support keyboard-only workflows.

## 2025-05-16 - Tabbed Interface Locator Specificity
**Learning:** In responsive layouts where navigation tabs share names with content labels or action buttons (e.g., a "Fields" tab and a "Fields" export button), Playwright's `getByRole('button', { name: '...' })` becomes ambiguous.
**Action:** Use `{ exact: true }` when targeting navigation tabs or ensure they have unique ARIA roles/labels to prevent E2E test failures on mobile viewports.
